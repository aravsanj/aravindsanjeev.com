Technological innovation is the _compression of space and time_. We have gone from,

- Sailing ships to jet airplanes
- Handwritten letters to instant messages
- Weekly news to watch live
- Physical copies to infinite libraries
- Market stalls to one-click buy

Ad infinitum.

The latest chapter in this story is _artificial intelligence_. Something I been playing with since my early access to GitHub Copilot in 2021.

The story has evolved since then. Our hero has grown. And the character arc is too charming to ignore.

Enough with the foreplay, let's decode the question:

> Should you integrate AI to your product?

This is a question that needs to be _thought_ instead of being _answered_. It is not a binary choice.

I will help you build a framework to think. But to build some conviction (and then to take it away), we will look at some numbers.

## The AI spending mandate

Investment in AI has grown 13x since 2014. Corporate investment in AI reached $252.3 billion in 2024 alone. [^1]

Generative AI funding alone reached $33.9 billion in 2024. Up 18.7% from 2023. [^1]

The first 3 quarters of 2025 saw $192.7 billion in VC funding for AI startups. Up 12.5% from 2024. [^2]

In 2025, AI-related ventures captured nearly 50% of all global startup funding, up from 34% in the previous year. [^3]

The data has spoken, _we are in the AI era_.

But this is the spending side of the story. To gather a full picture, let's look at the adoption side.

## The AI adoption mandate

As of 2025, 88% of companies have adopted AI in at least one function. This is up from 78% in 2024. [^4]

The enterprise world _is_ moving towards AI-nativism. Integrating AI has evolved from speculation into a foundation.

But adoption numbers alone can be misleading. We need to understand what these adoption has meant for these companies.

Only 39% of respondents reported that AI adoption had any impact on their earnings. Even a much smaller amount (< 6%) attributed 5% of their EBIT (Earnings Before Interest And Taxes) to AI. [^4]

To sum it up,

- 61% of companies reported no impact on their earnings despite AI adoption
- 39% of companies reported some impact on their earnings after AI adoption
- Only 6% of companies attributed a serious impact on their earnings after AI adoption

So this was the part where I said I want to build conviction and then take it away.

Now this doesn't mean AI adoption is not worth it. It just means, you need undestand what you are getting into.

## The high performers

Three things are clear from our analysis so far:

1. AI investment is on the rise and at all time high.
2. AI adoption is on the rise and at all time high.
3. But only small minority have so far profited from AI adoption.

So our next natural path to explore is:

> What is the minority doing that the majority is not?

These organizations have mastered the 70-20-10 principle. 70% of AI success is predicated on people, processes, and cultural transformation, 20% on data and technology infrastructure, and only 10% on the specific algorithms or models selected.
