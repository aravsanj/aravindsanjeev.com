Technological innovation is the _compression of space and time_. We have gone from,

- Sailing ships to jet airplanes
- Handwritten letters to instant messages
- Weekly news to watch live
- Physical copies to infinite libraries
- Market stalls to one-click buy

Ad infinitum.

The latest chapter in this story is _artificial intelligence_. Something I been playing with since my early access to GitHub Copilot in 2021. 

The story has evolved since then. Our hero has grown. And the character arc is too charming to ignore.

Enough with the foreplay, let's decode the question:

> Should you integrate AI to your product?

This is a question that needs to be _thought_ instead of being _answered_. It is not a binary choice.

I will help you build a framework to think. But to build some conviction (and then to take it away), we will look at some numbers.

Investment in AI has grown 13x since 2014. Corporate investment in AI reached $252.3 billion in 2024 alone. [^1]

Generative AI funding alone reached $33.9 billion in 2024. Up 18.7% from 2023. [^1]

The first 3 quarters of 2025 saw $192.7 billion in VC funding for AI startups. Up 12.5% from 2024. [^2]

In 2025, AI-related ventures captured nearly 50% of all global startup funding, up from 34% in the previous year. [^3]

The data has spoken, _we are in the AI era_. But this is the spending side of the story. To gather a full picture, let's look at the adoption side.

## The AI mandate

The decision to integrate AI into your product has evolved from a speculative experiment into a foundational requirement.

The enterprise world is moving towards AI-nativism. 88% of  companies have adopted AI in at least one function.

However, only about 7% to 10% of companies successfully scaled AI adoption to contribute materially to their bottomline.

These organizations have mastered the 70-20-10 principle. 70% of AI success is predicated on people, processes, and cultural transformation, 20% on data and technology infrastructure, and only 10% on the specific algorithms or models selected.
