        I graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree in 2019. For the better
        or the worse, 2020 happened. I began working as a technical content
        writer online. Eventually, I started learning web development and I've
        been hooked ever since.

      <p>
        The projects I worked on ranges from simple static websites to
        full-blown applications. My goal is to create a seamless user experience
        that is both intuitive and visually appealing.

        I'm currently working as a full-stack engineer. I'm open to
        collaborating on new projects. Feel free to reach out to me via my
